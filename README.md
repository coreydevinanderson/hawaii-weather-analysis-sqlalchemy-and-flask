This repository contains Python code in Jupyter Notebooks for getting and analyzing weather data in Hawaii for vacation planning.

I used a Python server (via 'flask') to make the cleaned data available online.

----

Weather data were stored in an sqllite database and extracted using 'sqlalchemy', with cleaning in 'pandas'.

There are three Jupyter notebook files:
1) get_weather_data.ipynb
2) extra_temp_analysis_part_I.ipynb
3) extra_temp_analysis_part_II.ipynb

There is one Python file containing the code for the 'flask' app:
1) app.py

All code was written by Corey D. Anderson in Python with additional functionality from the following packages:<br>
-sqlalchemy<br>
-pandas<br>
-matplotlib<br>
-numpy<br>
-scipy<br>
-datetime<br>
