<strong>This repository contains Python code in Jupyter Notebooks for getting and analyzing weather station data.</strong>
----
Weather data were stored in an sqllite database and extracted using 'sqlalchemy', with processing in 'pandas'.

There are three Jupyter notebook files:
1) climate_starter.ipynb
2) bonus_analysis_1_starter.ipynb
3) bonus_analysis_2_starter.ipynb

There is one Python file containing the code for the 'flask' app:
1) app.py

All code was written by Corey D. Anderson in Python with additional functionality from the following packages:
-sqlalchemy
-pandas
-matplotlib
-numpy
-scipy
-datetime
